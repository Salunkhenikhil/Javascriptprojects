      <h1>Roronoa Zoro</h1>

      <!-- Introduction -->
      <p>
        Roronoa Zoro, also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is a main combatant of
        the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two swordsmen, one of the Senior
        Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and is publicly recognized as the
        right-hand man of his crew's captain Monkey D. Luffy. Formerly a bounty
        hunter, he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first to join
        it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.
      </p>

      <!-- Background and lineage -->
      <p>
        Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the
        grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew
        of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making him a matrilineal descendant of both the
        Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki
        Ryuma. As a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he
        created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one
        of the three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy
        and Sanji, who are referred to as the "Monster Trio". His dream is to
        become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise
        he made to his deceased childhood friend Kuina.
      </p>

      <!-- Bounties -->
      <p>
        In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former
        bounty hunter, Zoro, alongside his captain, is included among the ranks
        of the "Worst Generation," pirates who simultaneously reached the
        Sabaody Archipelago with bounties of over Beli 100,000,000 shortly
        before the Summit War, as well as Marshall D. Teach. Zoro gained his
        first bounty of Beli 60,000,000 after the Arabasta Arc. It later
        increased to Beli 120,000,000 after the Enies Lobby incident, then again
        to Beli 320,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on
        Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli 1,111,000,000.

      <!-- Appearance -->
      <h3>Appearance</h3>
      <p>
        Roronoa Zoro is a muscular man of average height with lightly tanned
        skin. He always carries his three swords along with him, bundled up with
        a green haramaki over his right hip, allowing him to easily draw them
        with his left hand. Of the three swords he has on his person, he has
        always been seen carrying the Wado Ichimonji, while his other two swords
        have varied over time due to them being destroyed and subsequently
        replaced with progressively better ones. Although his right hand is
        usually seen resting over them, he can also use this hand to pull his
        swords out before sitting down. He has three identical gold earrings on
        his left earlobe. Zoro normally keeps a black bandana tied around his
        left bicep and ties it around his head when he is fighting seriously
        against an opponent.
