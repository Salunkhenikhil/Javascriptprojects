      <h1>Roronoa Zoro</h1>
      <p>
        Roronoa Zoro,also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro is a main combatant of
        the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two swordsmen, one of the Senior
        Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet and is publicly recognized as the
        right-hand man of his crew's captain Monkey D. Luffy. Formerly a bounty
        hunter he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it,
        doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc
      </p>
      <p>
        Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the
        grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew
        of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making him a matrilineal descendant of both the
        Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki
        Ryuma As a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he
        created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one
        of the three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy
        and Sanji, who are referred to as the "Monster Trio". His dream is to
        become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise
        he made to his deceased childhood friend Kuina.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former
        bounty hunter, Zoro, alongside his captain are included among the ranks
        of the "Worst Generation", pirates who simultaneously reached the
        Sabaody Archipelago with bounties of over Beli100,000,000 shortly before
        the Summit War, as well as Marshall D. Teach. Zoro gained his first
        bounty of Beli60,000,000 after the Arabasta Arc. It later increased to
        Beli120,000,000 after the Enies Lobby incident, then again to
        Beli320,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on
        Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli1,111,000,000.

      <h3>Appearance</h3>
      <p>
        Roronoa Zoro is a muscular man of average height with lightly tanned
        skin. He always carries his three swords along with him, bundled up with
        a green haramaki over his right hip, allowing him to easily draw them
        with his left hand. Of the three swords he has on his person, he has
        always been seen carrying the Wado Ichimonji, while his other two swords
        have varied over time due to them being destroyed and subsequently
        replaced with progressively better ones. Although his right hand is
        usually seen resting over them, he can also use this hand to pull his
        swords out before sitting down. He has three identical gold earrings on
        his left earlobe. Zoro normally keeps a black bandana tied around his
        left bicep and ties it around his head when he is fighting seriously
        against an opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zoro's body is covered with scars from his many battles, most notably
        the massive scar stretching from his left shoulder to his right hip that
        he acquired during his loss against the world's greatest swordsman,
        Dracule Mihawk, at Baratie. His other visible scars are the scars he
        inflicted upon his ankles in a desperate attempt to free himself from
        Mr. 3's Tokudai Candle Service Set by trying to cut his feet off at
        Little Garden. After the timeskip, he gained another scar over his left
        eye, obtained through unknown means. Zoro's other remarkable feature is
        his cropped green hair, which Sanji often teases him about by calling
        him "marimo" (moss-ball, moss-head in the VIZ manga and Funimation dub)
        due to its resemblance to one.
      </p>
      <h3>Before the Timeskip</h3>
      <p>
        Similar to most of his male crewmates, Zoro has the same outfit
        throughout most of the series. Before the timeskip, he would
        consistently wear black trousers tucked inside black boots, a plain
        white shirt with three undone buttons at the collar and his green
        haramaki. However, only Zoro's shirt varies from time to time in the
        arcs.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the Arlong Park Arc, he disembarked Sanji's fishing ship
        neglecting to put on a shirt. After beating up most of Arlong's crew, he
        wore an opened, navy-blue shirt decorated with light blue whirlpools
        that he stole from one of the fish-men. Since Zoro received his scar
        from Mihawk during the Baratie Arc before the Arlong Park Arc, Zoro wore
        bandages that were visible underneath his shirt. During the Loguetown
        Arc, Zoro acquires Sandai Kitetsu and Yubashiri to replace the two
        conventional katana which were broken by Mihawk in the Baratie Arc.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the Drum Island Arc, Zoro was bundled up for the winter island,
        but later stripped down after a foolish choice to swim in the frigid
        water on the island. He remained shirtless and shoeless in the beginning
        of the arc after getting lost from the Going Merry and left unable to
        redress himself, until he stole a parka from a man in Wapol's army,
        which was a hooded, forest green parka with a light green sash and white
        fur on the cuffs, hood, and hem, as well as a pair of boots. During the
        Arabasta Arc, he wore an orange keffiyeh with a gold chain on his head,
        a long-sleeved white coat with black lines all over it, and the bottom
        of his black trousers were torn above his ankles.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the Skypiea Arc, he wore his usual outfit in the beginning of the
        arc until he took it off after fighting a sky shark to save Chopper from
        being eaten. Afterwards, he wore a long, deep blue tank top and goggles
        strapped either on his head or around his neck, which were later broken
        and discarded. During the Water 7 Arc, he wore his usual outfit until
        near the end, where he wore an unzipped, bright yellow jacket with a
        closed pocket flap on each side. He continued wearing this outfit
        throughout the Enies Lobby Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, he wore
        a black shirt with the Galley-La Company emblem on it in white. At the
        end of the Thriller Bark Arc, he wore an opened, gray shirt. He also
        replaced Yubashiri, which was rusted away by Shu in the Enies Lobby Arc,
        with Shusui, which was entrusted to him by the zombie of Ryuma brought
        to life by Brook's shadow. During the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, he wore
        an opened white shirt with red stripes. During his time at Kuraigana
        Island, shortly after being sent there by Bartholomew Kuma, he wore an
        opened, dark blue shirt. Since Zoro was critically injured when he
        arrived at the island, Perona patched him up, so bandages were all over
        his body.
